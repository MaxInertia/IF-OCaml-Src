## Opchecker

given a pair of characters `fst` and `snd`, checks that
provided text conforms to the following two conditions:

1. The number of appearances of both `fst` and `snd` must be equal.
2. The number of `snd` read never exceeds the number of `fst` read when scanning from left to right.

Defaults:
- `fst` = `(`
- `snd` = `)`
